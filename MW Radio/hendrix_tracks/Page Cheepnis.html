I ate a hot dog<br>
It tasted real good<br>
An'then I watched a movie<br>
From Hollywood<br>
<br>
I ate a hot dog<br>
It tasted real good<br>
Then I watched a movie<br>
From Hollywood<br>
<br>
Little Miss Muffett on a squat by me, yeah<br>
Took a turn around, I said: Can y'all see now?<br>
The little strings on the Giant Spider?<br>
The Zipper From The Black Lagoon?<br>
(HOO HOO HA HA HA!)<br>
The vents by the tanks where the bubbles go up?<br>
(And the flaps on the side of the moon)<br>
<br>
The jelly & paint on the 40 watt bulb<br>
They use when the slime droozle off<br>
The rumples & the wrinkles in the cardboard rock, yeah<br>
And the canvas of the cave is too soft<br>
<br>
The suits & the hats & the tie's too wide<br>
And too short for the scientist man<br>
The chemistry lady with the roll-away mind, yeah<br>
While the monster just ate Japan<br>
<br>
Ladies and gentlemen,<br>
The monster,<br>
Which the peasants in this area call FRENCHIE<br>
(A very large poodle dog)<br>
Has just been seen approaching the airport<br>
Bullets can't stop it<br>
Rockets can't stop it<br>
There's no way we can let it go through customs tonight!<br>
<br>
GOT A GREAT BIG HEAVY THING<br>
GOT A GREAT BIG HAIRY THING<br>
(Yes, he does!)<br/>
GOT A GREAT BIG HEAVY THING<br>
GOT A GREAT BIG HAIRY THING<br>
<br>
GOT A GREAT BIG HEAVY THING<br>
GOT A GREAT BIG HAIRY THING<br>
GOT A GREAT BIG HEAVY THING<br>
GOT A GREAT BIG HAIRY THING ( Look out ! )<br>
<br>
This mornin', this mornin'<br>
When I ordered some breakfast<br>
I told them to bring me three eggs<br>
And they brought me three dozen, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
I opened up the bartender in my room<br>
To look outside<br>
Big old black cloud<br>
Hooverin' over, fillin' the side<br>
<br>
Soon I could see<br>
A big old horrible mountain (well!)<br>
Big old monster climbing over<br>
(Might shoot . . . )<br>
Trying to get somewhere<br>
I think his name was Frenchie (well . . . )<br>
I think his name was Frenchie<br>
Frenchie, hey-hey<br>
Frenchie, hey-hey<br>
Frenchie, hey-hey<br>
<br>
Somebody said: "Look out!"<br>
(Might shoot something)<br>
Somebody said: "Hey!" (well!)<br>
Before we leave just a little bit a longer<br>
A big old hairy poodle<br>
(Well, might shoot something on ya)<br>
Comin' to get ya<br>
Tryin' to spout something on ya<br>
I wonder what it was<br>
I said I wonder what it was<br>
I said WOW!<br>
<br>
A big old white and milky substance (might shoot something)<br>
Comin' at ya (well)<br>
A big old white and milky substance (at ya)<br>
Comin' at ya<br>
Look out for the hairy poodle<br>
It might shoot somethin' on ya (ay!)<br>
Look out for the hairy poodle (well)<br>
It might shoot somethin' on ya (well)<br>
Look out for the hairy poodle (hairy)<br>
It might shoot somethin' on ya (hairy)<br>
Look out for the hairy poodle (hairy)<br>
It might shoot . . . look it here (hairy)<br>
Follow me, an' go to the shelter!<br>
Follow me, an' go to the shelter!<br>
